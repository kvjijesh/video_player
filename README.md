# Overview
This is a simple video player application built using react and tailwind css. For state management purpose, I have used state and redux in this project. I have also used react-router-dom fo routing purpose.
The home page contains videos listed in it and I have provided the option to order the videos on the basis of alphatical order. On clicking the video, it will be played in a video player. Video tag is use for playing video. No external libraries where used.
